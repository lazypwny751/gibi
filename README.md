**gibi.sh** is a minimal, POSIX-compliant package helper script.  
It’s not a package manager. Not yet. But it can install and uninstall software from source in a simple and predictable way.

No dependencies, no magic, just shell.

## ✨ Features

- 💡 100% POSIX-compliant
- 🧱 No external dependencies (only `git` required)
- 📦 Simple URL-based package format
- 🧼 Lightweight, hackable, readable

## 🚀 Usage

```sh
./gibi.sh -d ~/.local/share/gibi        # setup directory
./gibi.sh -i github.com/user/repo       # install
./gibi.sh -r github.com/user/repo       # remove
./gibi.sh -v                            # show version
./gibi.sh -h                            # show help
```

### Package Format

```
site.domain/username/repo
```

Example:

```sh
gibi.sh -i github.com/lazypwny751/gibi
